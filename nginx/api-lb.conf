    # DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT: Using round-robin load balancing
    # This cycles through all regional servers on each request, which is useful
    # for testing that all API server replicas are working correctly.
    #
    # PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT: Should use geo-aware load balancing instead.
    # Options include:
    #   - Cloud provider load balancers
    #   - Cloudflare Load Balancing with geo-steering
    #   - nginx with GeoIP2 module for routing based on client location
    #   - Anycast DNS with regional endpoints
    #
    # Geo-aware routing ensures users connect to the nearest regional server,
    # reducing latency and keeping user data in their preferred region.
